Age Groups vs Brewery Count


  For this analysis I wanted to explore the relationship between the amount of breweries compared to the age groups outlined in the US Census. 
Some of the limitations with the data were that the age groups were pre determined, therefore some people that were younger are left out of the data set. However,the argument for how many twenty one through twenty three year olds prefer breweries to nightclubs, bars etc can be made on a separate analysis.  Lastly, sorting data was a nightmare. The US Census has so much data with different variables that will be called index, as well as different formats such as JSON, csv or shp, in my case. Therefore, learning how to manipulate and sort data was where the majority of my time went. Graphing the data was also a challenge, since choropleth map in python was new to me. In addition, learning how to overlay or add text that hovers allowed me to add all the information needed to the graphs. In total I had three graphs that accounted for the pre-determined groups (24-34, 35-54, 55-64)
